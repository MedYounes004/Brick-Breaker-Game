Breakout Game
Overview
This is a classic Breakout-style game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with jQuery. The player controls a paddle to bounce a ball and break bricks arranged at the top of the game area. The objective is to clear all bricks while maintaining lives. Bonus items may spawn when bricks are destroyed, adding an extra layer of interaction.
Features

Paddle Movement: Controlled by mouse movement, allowing smooth horizontal positioning.
Ball Physics: The ball bounces off walls, the paddle, and bricks with dynamic angles based on where it hits the paddle.
Bricks: Arranged in a 5x10 grid, each worth 10 points when destroyed.
Bonus Items: 30% chance to spawn when a brick is hit, falling toward the bottom of the screen.
Score and Lives Tracking: Displays current score and remaining lives.
Game Over and Reset: Game ends when lives reach zero, with an option to restart.

Technologies Used

HTML: Structures the game layout, including the game container, paddle, ball, and bricks.
CSS: Styles the game elements and ensures responsive centering.
JavaScript/jQuery: Handles game logic, event handling, and DOM manipulation.
External Library: jQuery (loaded via CDN) for simplified DOM operations and animations.

Setup Instructions

Clone or Download the Project:

Ensure you have all project files: index.html, styles.css, and game.js.


File Structure:
breakout-game/
├── index.html
├── styles.css
├── game.js


Dependencies:

The game uses jQuery, loaded via CDN in index.html. Ensure an internet connection or host the jQuery library locally if needed.


Running the Game:

Open index.html in a modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
No additional server setup is required, as the game runs entirely client-side.



How to Play

Start the Game:
Click anywhere in the game area to start the ball moving.


Control the Paddle:
Move your mouse left or right to position the paddle.


Objective:
Bounce the ball with the paddle to hit and destroy bricks.
Each brick destroyed adds 10 points to your score.
Catch falling bonus items (orange squares) for potential future enhancements (not currently implemented).


Lives:
You start with 3 lives. A life is lost if the ball falls below the paddle.
The game ends when all lives are lost, displaying a "Game Over" alert.


Reset:
After a game over, the game resets with a new brick grid, 3 lives, and a score of 0.



Known Limitations

Bonus Items: Currently, bonus items fall and disappear without affecting gameplay (e.g., no power-ups or score bonuses).
Responsiveness: The game area is fixed at 600px wide and may not adapt well to smaller screens.
No Pause Feature: The game continues running until a life is lost or the game ends.

Future Improvements

Add power-up effects for bonus items (e.g., paddle size increase, extra lives).
Implement a pause/resume feature.
Make the game responsive for different screen sizes.
Add sound effects and background music.
Include difficulty levels or increasing ball speed over time.
